Introduction
=================================

This work is an *R* approach to Data Analysis 💻 and modeling using the *tidyverse* packages. First, I became familiar with the different datasets and their visualizations of the various features and their (inter-related) properties. I mainly used *dplyr* for data manipulation and *ggplot2* for visualization. Since this is my first-ever data analysis, I added some explanations on how they work. These comments will help me in my future analysis and for readers to follow up on my work.

With this first milestone, I:

-[x]Become familiar with my dataset
-[x]Choose four questions that I liked to answer with my data
-[x]Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
