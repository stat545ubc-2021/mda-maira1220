Introduction
=================================
This is a public repository project as part of *STAT 545A* at UBC :school:. This project is an essential part of the course and is an *R* approach to Data Analysis 💻 and modeling using the different packages described in each folder. Since this is my first-ever data analysis, I added some explanations on how they work. These comments will help me in my future analysis and for readers to follow up on my work. 

In this repository you will find 4 folders which are describe as follows:
