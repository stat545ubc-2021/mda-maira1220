Introduction
=================================

This work is an *R* approach to Data Analysis ðŸ’» and modeling using the *tidyverse* packages. First, I became familiar with the different datasets and their visualizations of the various features and their (inter-related) properties. I mainly used *dplyr* for data manipulation and *ggplot2* for visualization. Since this is my first-ever data analysis, I added some explanations on how they work. These comments will help me in my future analysis and for readers to follow up on my work.

First milestone, I:

-Become familiar with my dataset

-Choose four questions that I liked to answer with my data

-Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown

Second milestone: 
This time, I explore the concept ofÂ tidy dataÂ more in-depth and investigate further into my research questions defined in milestone 1. As in milestone 1, I added some explanations for each of the four research questions. These comments will help me in my future analysis and for readers to follow up on my work.
