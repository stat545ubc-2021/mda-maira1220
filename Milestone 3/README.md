Welcome to Milestone 3 
=================================
In this milestone, I sharpened some of the results I obtained from my previous milestone by:

- [x] Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
- [x] Fitting a model object to my data, and extract a result.
- [x] Reading and writing data as separate files.

You will find:
- [x] [Minidata-3.md](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-maira1220/blob/main/Milestone%203/Minidata-3.md)
- [x] [Minidata 3.Rmd](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-maira1220/blob/main/Milestone%203/Minidata%203.Rmd)
- [x] [Markdown figures](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-maira1220/tree/main/Milestone%203/Minidata-3_files/figure-gfm)

This work was a great start into the Data Analysis world ðŸ’» and modeling, I truly enjoyed learning different packages and also about Vancouver trees!!! :evergreen_tree: :evergreen_tree: :evergreen_tree:
