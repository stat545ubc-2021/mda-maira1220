Welcome to Milestone 2 
=================================
This work is an *R* approach to Data Analysis and modeling using different packages. This time, I will explore the concept of tidy data more in-depth and investigate further into my research questions defined in milestone 1.

As in milestone 1, I added some explanations for each of the four research questions. These comments will help me in my future analysis and for readers to follow up on my work.
